# LoLScore
## Display Ranked Leauge of Legends Wins and Losses in an OBS Browser source

You can host this app yourself or you can use my online hosted version (lolscore.carrotbyte.net)

Just add the following link as an OBS browser source!

`http://lolscore.carrotbyte.net/<region>/<username>/<tag>`

You can add /kd to the end to also display K/D

`http://lolscore.carrotbyte.net/<region>/<username>/<tag>/kd`

Should support all regions across Americas, Europe, and Asia

Supports all region values. When in doubt it can be easier to use `na`, `eu`, `asia`, or `sea`; for your region input based on your major region. 

*Formerly lolscore.cottoncarrot.net, this url still works until June 2025*
